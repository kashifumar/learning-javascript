### Overview of JavaScript
<p style="text-align:justify">
JavaScript is a popular, high-level programming language primarily used to create interactive web pages and dynamic web applications. It was first introduced in 1995 and has since grown to become one of the most widely used languages on the web.

JavaScript is a client-side scripting language, meaning that it runs on the user's browser, as opposed to the server-side code that runs on the web server. It is often used in conjunction with HTML and CSS to create engaging user interfaces, manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) of a web page, and interact with web servers and databases.

Some of the key features of JavaScript include its support for object-oriented programming, dynamic typing, functional programming, and asynchronous programming. It also has a vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks, such as React, Angular, and Vue, which provide developers with powerful tools for building complex web applications.

JavaScript is a versatile language, and it has applications beyond just web development. For example, it can be used for server-side programming with technologies like Node.js, and it can be used to build desktop and mobile applications using tools like Electron and React Native.

In summary, JavaScript is a powerful, flexible, and widely used programming language that plays a vital role in modern web development and beyond.
